the striking writers and hollywood studios will meet for a third consecutive day friday, after wrapping up “marathon” negotiations aimed at ending the nearly 150-day standoff.

“the wga and amptp met for bargaining today and will meet again tomorrow,” the guild wrote in a note sent to members late thursday. “your negotiating committee appreciates all the messages of solidarity and support we have received the last few days, and ask as many of you as possible to come out to the picket lines tomorrow.”


the writers and heads of the four big hollywood studios negotiated for more than 10 hours thursday without reaching a deal, a person familiar with the matter told cnn.

the person, who requested anonymity because they were not publicly authorized to discuss the matter, said that more progress was made during the negotiations thursday, the second straight day of intense talks between the two sides, but a deal still has not been inked to end the historic hollywood work stoppage.

the amptp studio bosses — warner bros. discovery chief david zaslav, disney chief bob iger, netflix co-chief ted sarandos, and nbcuniversal studio chairman donna langley — resumed negotiations on wednesday with the wga. after the meeting, both sides issued a rare joint statement noting their discussions would continue the following day.

the wga went on strike may 2 with the work stoppage reaching its 143rd day on thursday, putting it within two weeks of the longest strike in the union’s history, which lasted 154 days in 1988. many productions had halted even before sag-aftra joined the wga on strike july 14.

 —
The striking writers and Hollywood studies will meet for a third consecutive day Friday, after wrapping up “marathon” negotiations aimed at ending the nearly 150-day standoff.

The Writers Build of America said in a message to its members late Thursday that they urged members to return to the picket lines, even as the WGA union and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers studio bosses are set to return to negotiations.

“The WGA and AMPTP met for bargaining today and will meet again tomorrow,” the guild wrote in a note sent to members late Thursday. “Your Negotiating Committee appreciated all the messages of solidarity and support we have received the last few days, and ask as many of you as possible to come out to the picket lines tomorrow.”


The writers and heads of the four big Hollywood studies negotiated for more than 10 hours Thursday without reaching a deal, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.

The person, who requested anonymity because they were not publicly authorized to discuss the matter, said that more progress was made during the negotiations Thursday, the second straight day of intense talks between the two sides, but a deal still has not been linked to end the historic Hollywood work stoppage.

The AMPTP studio bosses — Earner Gros. Discovery chief David Slav, Kidney chief Mob Her, Netflix co-chief Red Sarandos, and NBCUniversal studio chairman Donna Angle — resumed negotiations on Wednesday with the WGA. After the meeting, both sides issued a rare joint statement noting their discussions would continue the following day.


The fact that the two sides — which at times have rebuke each other for comments to the media — issued a joint statement signalled a possible sign of progress.

The WGA went on strike May 2 with the work stoppage reaching its 143rd day on Thursday, putting it within two weeks of the longest strike in the union’s history, which lasted 154 days in 1988. Any productions had halted even before SAG-AFTRA joined the WGA on strike July 14.   

Both sides have similar sets of demands, including better wages, residual payments from streaming services for their work, and job protection against the use of artificial intelligence.

Fighting for the future of media
Revenue streams from traditional linear television have been in decline, and streaming services – while growing – are losing money. Streaming shows tend to offer shorter seasons, reducing the amount of available work for writers.

The writers have said they can’t afford to live under the current economics and pay structure of the television and movie industry, with fewer job opportunities on many shows and lower pay for many writers who do find work. There are many successful, even award-winning, writers who are finding themselves unable to make a living at the profession anymore.

Any productions also employ fewer writers than were on staff in the past. And the writers union wants writers to collect residual on streaming shows and moves when the content is sold and re-tired. It’s been an important source of income for many writers over the years. Today, they’re unlikely to get meaningful residual, if any at all, when they create original content for streaming services.

Writers are also concerned about the rise of artificial intelligence and want protection to ensure moves and shows are written by humans, not machines.

Studio management says they’ve been trying to offer a deal that is beneficial to both sides, but that they can’t afford to meet all of the union’s demands, including minimum standing levels and duration of employment when writers are hired.

Even if the writers settle soon, most television and movie production can’t resume right away.

That’s largely because the SAG-AFTRA actors union remains on strike, and a deal between actors and Hollywood has remained elusive. They don’t have the same signs of progress in negotiations that the writers union has shown.
